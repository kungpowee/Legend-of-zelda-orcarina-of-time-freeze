Legend-of-zelda-orcarina-of-time-freeze
=======================================

ok what had happened was that i went to the happy mask shop in normal orcarina of time nott master quest k so i bought the keaton mask for the guard at death mountain so as soon as i left i put the mask on like 2/3 seconds after link walked out the door and the word market was barely fading in  and i put the mask on  but then for some  reason the game froze on me but i stilll kept playing music so then i thought  it was just my tablet actin up so i charged it and  went to sleep so the i woke up and went to mupen 64 again back to legend of zelda  and then loaded my save and then it was just a black screen but still playing the same music  pleaase help  loz is my fave game
